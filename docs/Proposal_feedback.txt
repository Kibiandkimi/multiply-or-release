Good proposal.

MoR isn't something that I was familiar with, but seems interesting enough.
Implementing the system in Bevy seems like a reasonable project.  I know that
Bevy is a pretty popular framework in Rust, though only a couple of teams over
the past few years have attempted to implement something in it.  (Last year, one
team made a clone of the Google Chrome dinosaur game as one half of their
project.)  I do believe that it has been getting better and easier to use.

Good to identify some of the key data structures.  It seems that most of the
interactions are fairly simple, so it may not be necessary to implement a
sophisticated physics engine.  Alternatively, you might find a suitable engine
available as a Bevy system.  But, be sure that there remains sufficient "heavy
lifting" in the Rust code that you write, rather than simply hooking together
existing systems.  Presumably Bevy already provides some
parallelism/concurrency, but that would be a good way of improving the
peformance and increasing the sophistication of the project.

Certainly lots of ways to add to the simulation.  Even if there isn't a lot of
interactivity, some UI (e.g., controlling the speed of the simulation) would be
good.


Score: 10/10
